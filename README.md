# Deep Learning with Information Fusion and Model Interpretation for Health Monitoring of Fetus based on Long-term Prenatal Electronic Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring Data

Long-term fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring during the antepartum period, increasingly popularized by electronic FHR monitoring, represents a growing approach in FHR monitoring. This kind of continuous monitoring, in contrast to the short-term one, collects an extended period of fetal heart data. This offers a more comprehensive understanding of fetus's conditions. However, the interpretation of long-term antenatal fetal heart monitoring is still in its early stages, lacking corresponding clinical standards. Furthermore, the substantial amount of data generated by continuous monitoring imposes a significant burden on clinical work when analyzed manually. 
To address above challenges, this project develops an automatic analysis system named LARA (Long-term Antepartum Risk Analysis system) for continuous FHR monitoring, combining deep learning and information fusion methods. LARA's core is a well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) model. It processes long-term FHR data as input and generates a Risk Distribution Map (RDM) and Risk Index (RI) as the analysis results.
